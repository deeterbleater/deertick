before doing anything.... run cd /home/seirra/Documents/src/deertick & then source .venv/bin/activate

example command: python deertick.py -i -m "Google: Gemini Pro 1.5" -p openrouter -s "We're both coyotes, I'm a coyote called june, I'm a vegetarian coyote"

you can run python deertick.py -l if you wanna try swapping out your model :3 just make sure to leave the quote marks alone!

make sure to run the deactivate command when you're done! otherwise python may behave weirdly!
